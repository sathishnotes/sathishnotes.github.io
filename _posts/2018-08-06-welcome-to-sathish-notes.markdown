This is my `first post` in this blog. I feel great in making this blog available for everyone who wish to follow my `leads and shares in Education & Technology` together.

I mostly believe that betterment in Education can be brought not by changing the students but by `changing the Environment` around the students. Once the Environment is ready for cooking, I'm sure the cooked food will be a great Recipe.
  
Towards that Change, I believe that `this blog will be a stepping stone` to make the students aware of the Technology around them and thereby getting them `close to the opportunities` available.

{% highlight python %}
print("Dear Friends")
share_this_page = True
if share_this_page == True:
    print("Sharing this page")
    print("Serves the purpose better")
    print("Thank you")
{% endhighlight %}
