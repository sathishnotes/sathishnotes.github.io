There are more interconnected field of studies in Computer Science which are often misunderstood like Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep Learning, etc.

Definitions of Artificial Intelligence from [ElementsOfAI](https://www.elementsofai.com/):

    * cool things that computers can't do
    * machines imitating intelligent human behavior
    * autonomous and adaptive systems

Let me also make one of my own definition for AI:

> AI is a field of study in Computer Science which involves giving machines
> "human intelligence" with the help of sub-fields like machine-learning, deep-learning, data-science, etc.

Go through the following examples from [ElementsOfAI](https://www.elementsofai.com/) which I believe help you to get a clear idea about Which are AI and Which are not ?

Is an AI | Not an AI
------------ | -------------
Predicting the stock market by fitting a curve to past data about stock prices  | Spreadsheet that calcualtes sums and other pre-defined functions on given data
A GPS navigation system for finding the fastest route | Big data storage solutions that can store huge amounts of data (such as images or video) and stream them to many users at the same time
A music recommendation system such as Spotify that suggests music based on the user's listening behavior | Photo editing features such as brightness and contrast in applications such as Photoshop
Style transfer filters in applications suuch as Prisma that take a photo and transform it into different art styles (impressionist, cubist, ...) | 


Machine Learning: 

>Systems that improve their performance in a given task with more and more experience or data.

Data Science:

>Includes Machine Learning and Statistics, & certain aspects of computer science including algorithms, data storage,
>and Web application development.

Robotics:

>Building and programming robots so that they can operate in complex, real-world scenarios.

Statistics:

>The Practice or science of collecting and analysing numerical data in large quantities, especially for the purpose of
>inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample.

See the following table to see for yourselves the `real-world examples` of Statistics, Robotics, Machine Learning, etc from [ElementsOfAI](https://www.elementsofai.com/). 

Example | Statistics | Robotics | Machine Learning
------------ | ------------ | ------------- | -------------
Autonomous cars apply a wide range of techniques to function. These include statistics, robotics, and machine learning. | YES | YES | YES
Steering a rocket into orbit | NO | YES | NO
Online ad Optimization | YES | NO | YES
Customer service chatbot | NO | NO | YES
Summarizing gallup results | YES | NO | NO
