Before getting into the topic, I just want you all to know that this process is not the only way to deliver sessions using Github. I'm sure that there are quite lot of other faculties who are taking their teaching - learning process in a different way using Github. I'm sharing this, so that other faculty friends could use this, if they find it useful.

I have to admit that after using Github classroom for a while now, I was able to concentrate much on the discussion of the topics & clearing students doubts rather than on the distribution and collection of assignments from students.

Here is the teaching-learning-evaluation process which I follow for my `Full Stack Development - Training` batch with screenshots to make you understand easily:

1. Create a team in our Github Organization account.

2. Add Student members in it

3. Add the repos to the team repositories with needed files to deliver the session before every session.

4. Students will then clone the repos to do hands-on and to follow all along the session.

5. Create new classroom in https://classroom.github.com. Create Individual Assignment for every assignment and share the classroom assignment link via team discussion forum in GitHub

6. Students complete their assignments and submit the assignments by pushing their assignments to the created assignment repos

7. Post the Random mapping order for every assignment,Generated using R-Script for adding collaborators to each of their repos in the GitHub Team Discussions forum, so that the collaborator(student peer) can read the repository and evaluate the code in it.

8. The evaluation score is updated via Google form, the link of which again was already posted through GitHub Team Discussions forum.

9. The students who evaluated their peer assignment, share the feedback to their peers via Team Discussions Forum.

10. Generate the assignment analysis report through the excel downloaded from google form using R or Python of your choice.

I've described the teaching-learning-evaluation process using GitHub for two reasons:
1. May be the listed process can be useful to other Educators.
2. To get your inputs / ways to improve this process further.
