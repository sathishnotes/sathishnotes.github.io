Before getting into the topic, I just want you all to know that this process is *not the only way* to deliver sessions using **Github**. I'm sure that there are quite lot of other faculties who are taking their `teaching - learning process` in a different way using Github. I'm sharing this, so that other faculty friends could use this, if they find it useful.

I have to admit that after using **Github classroom** for a while now, I was able to concentrate much on the discussion of the topics & clearing students doubts rather than on the distribution and collection of assignments from students.

Here is the teaching-learning-evaluation process numbered from 1 to 10, which I follow for my `Full Stack Development - Training` batch with screenshots to make you understand easily:

- __Team Creation in Github Organization Account__

> Go to your organization <br /><br />

> Create a team in your Github Organization account.<br /><br />

![Enroll Students](https://github.com/sathishnotes/sathishnotes.github.io/raw/master/assets/3.jpg)<br /><br />  

- __Enroll Students__<br /><br />

> Add Student members in it<br /><br />

- __Add Teaching Materials before Session Delivery__<br /><br />  

> Add the repos to the team repositories with needed files to deliver the session before every session.<br /><br />  

![Add Repos](https://github.com/sathishnotes/sathishnotes.github.io/raw/master/assets/5.jpg)<br /><br />  


- __Students Clone the Materials to follow the session__<br /><br />  

> Students will then clone the repos to do hands-on and to follow all along the session.<br /><br />

- __Create new classroom and Distribute Assignment__<br /><br />  

> Create new classroom in [https://classroom.github.com](https://classroom.github.com)<br /><br />  

![Classroom Creation](https://github.com/sathishnotes/sathishnotes.github.io/raw/master/assets/7.jpg)<br /><br />  

> Create Individual Assignment for every assignment<br /><br />  

![Assignment Creation](https://github.com/sathishnotes/sathishnotes.github.io/raw/master/assets/8.jpg)<br /><br />  

> and share the classroom assignment link via team discussion forum in GitHub<br /><br />  

![Assignment Distribution](https://github.com/sathishnotes/sathishnotes.github.io/raw/master/assets/7-1.jpg)<br /><br />  

- __Assignment Submission__<br /><br />  

> Students complete their assignments and submit the assignments by pushing their assignments to the created assignment repos<br /><br />  

![Assignment Collection](https://github.com/sathishnotes/sathishnotes.github.io/raw/master/assets/9.jpg)<br /><br />  


- __Peer Evaluation Order__<br /><br />  

> Post the Random mapping order for every assignment,Generated using R-Script for adding collaborators to each of their repos in the GitHub Team Discussions forum, so that the collaborator(student peer) can read the repository and evaluate the code in it.<br /><br />  

![Peer Evaluation Order](https://github.com/sathishnotes/sathishnotes.github.io/raw/master/assets/10.jpg)<br /><br />    


- __Peer evaluation score entry__<br /><br />  

> The evaluation score is updated via Google form, the link of which again was already posted through GitHub Team Discussions forum<br /><br />

- __Peer Evaluation Feedback__<br /><br />  

> The students who evaluated their peer assignment, share the feedback to their peers via Team Discussions Forum<br /><br />

- __Assignment Report Generation__<br /><br />  

> Generate the assignment analysis report through the excel downloaded from google form using R or Python of your choice.<br /><br />

**I've described the teaching-learning-evaluation process using GitHub for two reasons:**
 - May be the listed process can be useful to other Educators.
 - To get inputs / ways to improve this process further.

Any feedback on this process is appreciated !!!
