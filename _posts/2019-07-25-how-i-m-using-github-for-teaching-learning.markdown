Before getting into the topic, I just want you all to know that this process is *not the only way* to deliver sessions using **Github**. I'm sure that there are quite lot of other faculties who are taking their `teaching - learning process` in a different way using Github. I'm sharing this, so that other faculty friends could use this, if they find it useful.

I have to admit that after using **Github classroom** for a while now, I was able to concentrate much on the discussion of the topics & clearing students doubts rather than on the distribution and collection of assignments from students.

Here is the teaching-learning-evaluation process numbered from 1 to 10, which I follow for my `Full Stack Development - Training` batch with screenshots to make you understand easily:

1. __Team Creation in Github Organization Account__

Go to your organization

   Create a team in your Github Organization account.

2. __Enroll Students__

Add Student members in it

3. __Add Teaching Materials before Session Delivery__  

Add the repos to the team repositories with needed files to deliver the session before every session.

4. __Students Clone the Materials to follow the session__  

Students will then clone the repos to do hands-on and to follow all along the session.

5. __Create new classroom and Distribute Assignment__  

Create new classroom in [https://classroom.github.com](https://classroom.github.com).

Create Individual Assignment for every assignment

and share the classroom assignment link via team discussion forum in GitHub

6. __Assignment Submission__  

Students complete their assignments and submit the assignments by pushing their assignments to the created assignment repos

7. __Peer Evaluation Order__  

Post the Random mapping order for every assignment,Generated using R-Script for adding collaborators to each of their repos in the GitHub Team Discussions forum, so that the collaborator(student peer) can read the repository and evaluate the code in it.

8. __Peer evaluation score entry__  

The evaluation score is updated via Google form, the link of which again was already posted through GitHub Team Discussions forum.

9. __Peer Evaluation Feedback__  

The students who evaluated their peer assignment, share the feedback to their peers via Team Discussions Forum.

10. __Assignment Report Generation__  

Generate the assignment analysis report through the excel downloaded from google form using R or Python of your choice.

I've described the teaching-learning-evaluation process using GitHub for two reasons:
 - May be the listed process can be useful to other Educators.
 - To get inputs / ways to improve this process further.

Any feedback on this process is appreciated !!!
