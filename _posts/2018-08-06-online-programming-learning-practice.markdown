There are quite a lot websites which provides way to `learn yourselves & practice` what you've learned and even there is a possibility of `GETTING HIRED !` in the companies that host the hiring challenges in these websites.

Some of the websites to start with are :

    * HackerRank
    * HackerEarth
    * ProjectEuler
    * Spoj
    * URI Judge
    * Guva
    * TechGig
    * CodeChef
    * CodeForces
    * TopCoder
    * GeeksForGeeks
    
There are even `self-paced learning tracks` designed specifically for cracking Coding Interviews & getting expertised is of great value I would say.Speaking of learning tracks, don't miss to check out `Interview Preparation Kit @ HackerRank` and `CodeMonk @ HackerEarth`.

Some provide certifications too. Like `CCDSAP Certification @ CodeChef`, which is considered to be a great value to programmers.
